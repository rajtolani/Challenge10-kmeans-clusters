# Challenge10-kmeans-clusters

This challenge is useful for gaining knowledge of scikit-learn library for unsupervised machine learning operations
Following Techniques are explored

    Use of KMeans to cluster Data
    Plotting of elbow curve to determin the optimum number of Clusters
    Use of PCA to reduce the number of Variables

    Use of Scikit to
            Create and initialize an instance of model.
            Train the model.
            Predict outcome

I think this challenge has been well designed to provide basic knowledge of unsupervised machine learning. The notebook can be modified to experiment with different parameters. Most interesting could be to change the number of components in the PCA model to see how it changes the elbow curve, explained_variance_ratio_ and clusters formed by KMeans

I would like to thanks the Bootcamp staff for providing such well documented starter Notebook. The challenge I find is that the notebook is allready so well commented that I cannot come up with any additional comments which will add value over and beyong the comments provided
